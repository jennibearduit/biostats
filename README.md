# BN2102 and ST1131 Assignments

This respository contains my lab assignment solutions for BN2102 Bioengineering Data Analysis (AY 19/20 Sem 2)
and ST1131 Introduction to Statistics & Statistical Computing (AY21/22 Sem 1). 

## About BN2102

BN2102 introduces concepts relevant to the interpretation and statistical analysis of experimental results in the bioengineering field.
Students learn to perform the most commonly used statistical analysis of experiments (e.g., z and t tests, ANOVA analysis),
as well as to interpret the results of typical bioengineering experiments by building a suitably fitted mathematical model.

## About ST1131

ST1131  introduces students to basic concepts and methods of statistics that will enable them to perform appropriate data analyses to uncover 
meaningful insights. The statistical software R is taught alongside the material to introduce statistical computing.
